### I chose the Indian Cities Rest API

#### Start repo on personal github/clone down repo/create directories models, db and planning/ install dependencies (mongoose, express and node-fetch)

#### files:

###### connection.js, seed.js, getCities.js(for fetch) going in db directory

###### Cities.js going in models directory

###### index.js top level

#### Set up connection.js

#### Reference countries api lab for fetch (creates data.json)/require node-fetch

#### Make model to match a city entry object from the fetched data

#### Seed data to mongodb using seed.js and by creating a new variable that maps my fetched api data into a new array of objects with the same keys and values. Populate the mongo database with the variable containing the mapped api data.

#### index.js at top level:

###### require models and express with () at end of require.

###### require body parser

###### CRUD routes 
###### routes for city, state, district
###### try to make query route

#### read through project requirements!
